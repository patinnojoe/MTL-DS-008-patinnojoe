MTL-DS-008 — NHS Waiting List Demand Forecasting & Capacity Planning
Project title
NHS Waiting List Demand Forecasting & Capacity Planning

Project type
Data Science · Team project · Production-style portfolio project

Challenge
NHS England publishes monthly Referral to Treatment (RTT) waiting-times data covering incomplete, admitted and non-admitted pathways across providers and treatment functions.

A planning team needs more than historical reporting. It needs a reproducible forecasting workflow that can estimate how waiting-list pressure may develop over the next few months and translate that forecast into operational planning insight.

Your team will build that forecasting system.

Official data sources
NHS England RTT waiting-times data:

https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/

Current 2026/27 RTT releases:

https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/rtt-data-2026-27/

Previous 2025/26 releases:

Use the full monthly CSV extracts rather than summary tables where available.

Required modelling scope
The core target is:

Monthly incomplete RTT pathways

Teams must choose and document a manageable forecasting grain, for example:

one provider over time;
selected providers;
one treatment function;
selected treatment functions;
provider × treatment-function series where sufficient history exists.
Do not attempt to model every provider and specialty at once.

Historical period
Use enough monthly history for time-series modelling.

Recommended minimum:

24–36 monthly observations where available.
Preferred:

extend further back where the schema and definitions remain sufficiently comparable.
A single monthly file is not enough for forecasting.

Cost requirement
The complete project must be achievable at £0.

Recommended free stack:

Python
pandas
NumPy
statsmodels
scikit-learn
matplotlib
XGBoost or equivalent if desired
Prophet if desired
Jupyter
Git
GitHub
No paid cloud platform or deployment service is required.

Core objective
Build a reproducible forecasting workflow that:

acquires and combines monthly RTT extracts;
validates and standardises the historical series;
defines a clear target and modelling grain;
explores trend, seasonality, structural breaks and anomalies;
establishes a baseline forecast;
compares at least two credible forecasting approaches;
uses time-based validation rather than random train/test splitting;
reports suitable forecast-error metrics;
produces uncertainty / prediction intervals where supported;
generates a 3–6 month planning forecast;
translates the forecast into operational capacity insight;
documents limitations and monitoring requirements.

Business questions
The solution should help answer:

Is the selected waiting list trending upward, downward or remaining stable?
Is there recurring seasonality?
How accurate is a simple baseline compared with more advanced models?
What volume is expected over the next 3–6 months?
How uncertain is that forecast?
Under what forecast conditions would planning teams need additional capacity?
Which assumptions or data limitations could materially affect the forecast?
Important modelling rule
This is not a competition to use the most complex algorithm.

A simpler model that performs better under time-based validation is preferred to a more sophisticated model with weaker evidence.

Team submission model
Each team creates its own GitHub repository.

Recommended naming:

MTL-DS-008-<team-name>

The Mettelo repository is the challenge specification.

Each team must:

create its own repository;
invite the designated Mettelo reviewer/collaborator;
follow project/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md;
use issues/branches/commits/pull requests as evidence of collaboration;
complete submission/FINAL_SUBMISSION.md;
complete final QA;
tag the accepted version v1.0-mettelo-submission;
submit the repository URL.
